This repository contains data and scripts used in the analysis of rural-urban mortality/morbidity in Brazil. This is a work in progress developed by former researchers from the [International Policy Centre for the Inclusive Growth](https://ipcig.org) and by researchers from the [Department of Demography of CEDEPLAR](https://www.cedeplar.ufmg.br/en/demography-program/the-program) (Federal University of Minas Gerais) and [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation](https://portal.fiocruz.br/en) (FIOCRUZ).
